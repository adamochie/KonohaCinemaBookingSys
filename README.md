# Konoha Cinema Booking System using C

My team were to create a simple system using C. Our CSC099 project is to figure out how to make a programme about cinema process. Such as, booking tickets, booking seats, buy beverage for cinema and discount for cinema’s membership. Using a lot of technique that we learn in CSC099, it really help our programming process and make it succeeded.

Up till now all the activities of the movie ticket booking processing was performed manually, it requires more human efforts to manage the each and every aspects of multiplex which is very costly process. To overcome all kind of problems being faced by movie ticket booking processing in various multiplexes develop movie ticket booking project. This project “Movie Ticket Booking System”will provide efficient and cost effective solution and always have possibilities of enhancement up any legal extend to satisfy user requirement
